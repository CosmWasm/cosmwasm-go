# Voter contract

The contract is a voting dApp where users have to pay for creating a new voting or for participating in an existing one.
A contract creator can release raised funds and buy himself a cup of coffee.

The purpose of creating this contract was to test every feature cosmwasm-go SDK provides.

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to run Unit / integration tests and build a WASM blob.
